The package **bmscstan** provides useful functions to fit
Bayesian Multilevel Single Case models (BMSC) using as
backend *Stan* [@Carpenter2017].

This approach is based on the seminal approach of the Crawford's tests
[@Crawford1998; @Crawford2005; @Crawford2010], using a small control
sample of individuals, 
to see whether the performance of the single case deviates from them.
Unfortunately, Crawford's tests are limited to a number of specific
experimental designs that do not allow researchers to use complex
experimental designs.

The BMSC approach is born mainly to deal with this problem: its purpose is,
in fact, to allow the fitting of models with the same flexibility
of a Multilevel Model, with single case and controls data.

The core function of the **bmscstan** package is `BMSC`,
whose theoretical assumptions, and its validation are
reported in [@scandola_romano_2020].

The syntax used by the `BMSC` function is extremely similar to the syntax
used in the `lme4` package. However, the specification of random effects
is limited, but it can cover the greatest part of cases
(for further details, please see `?bmscstan::randomeffects`).

## Example on real data

In order to show an example on the use of the **bmscstan** package,
the datasets in this package will be used.

In these datasets we have data coming from a Body Sidedness Effect paradigm
[@Ottoboni2005; @Tessari2012], that is a Simon-like paradigm useful to
measure body representation.

In this experimental paradigm, participants have to answer to a circle 
showed in the centre of the computer screen, superimposed to
an irrelevant image of a left or right hand, or to a left or right foot.

The circle can be of two colors (e.g. red or blue), and participants have
to press one button with the left when the circle is of a specific colour,
and with the right hand when the circle is of the another colour.

When the irrelevant background image (foot or hand) is incongruent with
the hand used to answer, the reaction times and frequency of errors are higher.

The two irrelevant backgrounds are administered in different experimental blocks.

This is considered an effect of the body representation.

In the package there are two datasets, one composed by 16 healthy control
participants, and the other one by an individual affected by right unilateral
brachial plexus lesion (however, s/he could independently press the
keyboard buttons).

## Explore the data

The datasets are called `data.pt` for the single case, and `data.ctrl` for the
control group, and they can be loaded using `data(BSE)`.

In these datasets there are the Reaction Times `RT`, a `Body.District` factor
with levels FOOT and HAND, a `Congruency` factor (levels: Congruent,
Incongruent), and a `Side` factor (levels: Left, Right). In the `data.ctrl`
dataset there also is an `ID` factor, representing the different 16 control
participants.

```{r, fig.height= 6, fig.width= 6}
library(bmscstan)

data(BSE)

str(data.pt)

str(data.ctrl)

ggplot(data.pt, aes(y = RT, x = Body.District:Side , fill = Congruency))+
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(data.ctrl, aes(y = RT, x = Body.District:Side , fill = Congruency))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap( ~ ID , ncol = 4)
```

These data seem to have some outliers. Let see if they are normally distributed.

```{r , fig.show='hold'}
qqnorm(data.ctrl$RT, main = "Controls")
qqline(data.ctrl$RT)

qqnorm(data.pt$RT, main = "Single Case")
qqline(data.pt$RT)
```

They are not normally distributed. Outliers will be removed by using the
`boxplot.stats` function.

```{r , fig.show='hold'}
out <- boxplot.stats( data.ctrl$RT )$out
data.ctrl <- droplevels( data.ctrl[ !data.ctrl$RT %in% out , ] )

out <- boxplot.stats( data.pt$RT )$out
data.pt <- droplevels( data.pt[ !data.pt$RT %in% out , ] )

qqnorm(data.ctrl$RT, main = "Controls")
qqline(data.ctrl$RT)

qqnorm(data.pt$RT, main = "Single Case")
qqline(data.pt$RT)
```

They are not perfect, but definitively better.

## Deciding the contrasts and the random effects part

First of all, there is the necessity to think to our hypotheses, and setting
the contrast matrices consequently.

In all cases, our factors have only two levels. Therefore, we set
the factors with a Treatment Contrasts matrix, with baseline level
for `Side` the _Left_ level, for `Congruency` the _Congruent_ level, and for
`Body.District` the _FOOT_ level.

In this way, each coefficient will represent the difference between the
two levels.

```{r}
contrasts( data.ctrl$Side )          <- contr.treatment( n = 2 )
contrasts( data.ctrl$Congruency )    <- contr.treatment( n = 2 )
contrasts( data.ctrl$Body.District ) <- contr.treatment( n = 2 )

contrasts( data.pt$Side )            <- contr.treatment( n = 2 )
contrasts( data.pt$Congruency )      <- contr.treatment( n = 2 )
contrasts( data.pt$Body.District )   <- contr.treatment( n = 2 )
```


The use of the `BMSC` function, for those who are used to `lme4` or `brms`
syntax should be straightforward.

In this case, we want to fit the following model:

`RT ~ Body.District * Congruency * Side + (Congruency * Side | ID / Body.District)`

Unfortunately, `BMSC` does not directly allow the syntax `ID / Body.District`
in the specification of the random effects.

In any case, taking into consideration that `(1 | ID / Body.District)` is a
short
version of `(1 | ID : Body.District) + (1 | ID)`, it is possible to solve this
problem.

It is necessary to create a new variable for `ID : Body.District`

```{r}
data.ctrl$BD_ID <- interaction( data.ctrl$Body.District , data.ctrl$ID )
```

and the model would be:

`RT ~ Body.District * Congruency * Side + (Congruency * Side | BD_ID) + (Congruency * Side | ID)`

## Fitting the BMSC model

At this point, fitting the model is easy, and it can be done with the use of
a single function.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
mdl <- BMSC(formula = RT ~ Body.District * Congruency * Side +
             (Congruency * Side | ID) + (Congruency * Side | BD_ID),
             data_ctrl = data.ctrl,
             data_sc = data.pt,
             cores = 1,
             seed = 2020)
```

After fitting the model, we should check its quality by means of
Posterior Predictive P-Values [@Gelman2013] with the `bmscstan::pp_check`
function.

Thanks to this graphical function, we will see if the observed data and the
data sampled from the posterior distributions of our BMSC model are similar.

If we observe strong deviations, it means that your BMSC model is not adequately
describing your data. In this case, you might want to change the priors
distribution (see the `help` page), change the random effects structure,
or transform your dependent variable (using the logarithm or other math
functions).

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
pp_check( mdl )
```

In both the controls and the single case data, the Posterior Predictive P-Values
check seems to adequately resemble the observed data.

A further control on our model is given by checking the Effective Sample Size
(ESS)
for each coefficient and the $\hat{R}$ diagnostic index [@Gelman1992].

The ESS is the "effective number of simulation draws" for any coefficient,
namely the approximate number of independent draws, taking into account
that the various simulations in a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) are not 
independent each other. For further details, see an introductory book in
Bayesian Statistics. A good ESS estimates should be $ESS > 100$ or $ESS > 10\%$
of the total draws (remembering that you should remove the burn-in simulations
from the total iterations counting).

The $\hat{R}$ is an index of the convergence of the MCMCs. In `BMSC` the default
is 4. Usually, MCMCs are considered convergent when $\hat{R} < 1.1$ (*Stan*
default).

In order to check these values, the `summary.BMSC` function is needed
(see next section).

## The `summary.BMSC` output

The output of the `brmscstan::summary.BMSC` function is divided in four main
parts:

1. In the first part, the model and the selected priors are recalled.
2. In the second part, the coefficients of the fixed effects for the control
  group are shown.
3. In the third part, the coefficients of the fixed effects for the single
  case are shown.
4. In the fourth and last part, the fixed effects coefficients for the
  difference between the single case and the control group are shown.

```{r}
print( summary( mdl ) , digits = 3 )
```

In the second and fourth part of the output, we can observe a descriptive
summary reporting the mean, the standard error, the standard deviation,
the $2.5\%$, $25%$, $50\%$, $75\%$ and $97.5\%$ of the posterior distributions
of each coefficient. If we want the $95\%$ Credible Interval, we can consider
only the $2.5\%$ and $97.5\%$ extremes. Then, two diagnostic indexes are
reported: the `n_eff` parameter, that is the *ESS*, and the `Rhat` ($\hat{R}$).
Finally, the Savage-Dickey Bayes Factor is reported (*BF10*).

In the third part the diagnostic indexes are not reported because these
coefficients are computed as marginal probabilities from the
probabilities summarized in the second and fourth part.

## Understanding the `summary.BMSC` output

### Checking the diagnostic indexes

The first step should be controlling the diagnostic indexes.

In this model, all `n_eff` are greater than the $10\%$ of the total iterations 
(default iterations: 4000, default warmup iterations: 2000, default chains: 4 =
`r (4000 - 2000) * 4 / 10`). Also, all $\hat{R}s < 1.1$. Finally, we already
saw that the Posterior Predictive P-values are showing that the model is
representative of the data.

### The Control Group results

Then, observing what the fixed effects of the Control group are showing
is important before of seeing the differences with the single case.

In this analysis, there are 5 fixed effects which $BF_{10}$ is greater than
3 [@Raftery1995].

- Intercept $BF_{10} > 150$, $\mu = 199.88$, $95\%~CI = [184.55; 215.072]$.
- Body District $BF_{10} = 54.8$, $\mu = 17.20$, $95\%~CI = [6.22; 28.931]$.
- Congruency $BF_{10} = 21.2$, $\mu = 16.10$, $95\%~CI = [4.08; 30.272]$.
- Side $BF_{10} = 31.9$, $\mu = 19.11$, $95\%~CI = [5.01; 33.919]$.
- Body District : Congruency $BF_{10} = 3.81$, $\mu = -10.03$,
  $95\%~CI = [-19.84; -0.375]$.

We can have a general overview of the coefficients of the model with the
`plot.BMSC` function.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
plot( mdl , who = "control" )
```

The interaction between Body District and Congruency needs a further
analysis to better understand the phenomenon. It comes useful the function
`pairwise.BMSC`.

```{r}
pp <- pairwise.BMSC(mdl , contrast = "Body.District2:Congruency2" , who = "control")

print( pp , digits = 3 )
```

The output of this function is divided in two parts:

- a first part, called "Marginal distributions", where the marginal distributions of 
  each level of the coefficients are reported with a $BF_{10}$ against zero.
- a second part, called "Table of contrasts", with all possible pairwise
  comparisons and their $BF_{10}$.

It is also possible to plot the results of this function with the use of
`plot.pairwise.BMSC`.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
plot( pp )
```

Finally, it is possible to plot marginal posterior distributions for each
effects with $BF_{10} > 3$.

```{r, fig.show = "hold"}
p1 <- pairwise.BMSC(mdl , contrast = "Body.District2" ,  who = "control" )

plot( p1 )[[1]] +
  ggtitle("Body District" , subtitle = "Marginal effects") 

plot( p1 )[[2]] +
  ggtitle("Body District" , subtitle = "Contrasts") 

p2 <- pairwise.BMSC(mdl , contrast = "Congruency2" ,  who = "control" )

plot( p2 )[[1]] +
  ggtitle("Congruency" , subtitle = "Marginal effects")

plot( p2 )[[2]] +
  ggtitle("Congruency" , subtitle = "Contrasts")

p3 <- pairwise.BMSC(mdl , contrast = "Side2" ,  who = "control" )

plot( p3 )[[1]] +
  ggtitle("Side" , subtitle = "Marginal effects")

plot( p3 )[[2]] +
  ggtitle("Side" , subtitle = "Contrasts")
```

### The differences between the Control Group and the Single Case

Finally, the difference between the Control Group and the Single Case
is of interest.

A general plot can be obtained in the following way, plotting both
the Control Group and the Single Case:

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
plot( mdl ) +
  theme_bw( base_size = 18 )+
  theme( legend.position = "bottom",
         legend.direction = "horizontal")
```

or plotting only the difference

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
plot( mdl ,who = "delta" ) +
  theme_bw( base_size = 18 )
```

The relevant coefficients are:

- Intercept $BF_{10} > 150$, $\mu = 194.97$, $95\%~CI = [179.54; 210.071]$.
- Body District $BF_{10} = 134$, $\mu = 23.29$, $95\%~CI = [9.66; 36.945]$.
- Congruency $BF_{10} > 150$, $\mu = 31.04$, $95\%~CI = [16.30; 45.651]$.
- Side $BF_{10} > 150$, $\mu = 31.60$, $95\%~CI = [16.11; 46.469]$.
- Body District : Congruency $BF_{10} = 8.47$, $\mu = -16.82$,
  $95\%~CI = [-31.99; -1.750]$.
- Body District : Side $BF_{10} = 7.31$, $\mu = -16.61$,
  $95\%~CI = [-31.49; -1.474]$.
- Body District : Congruency : Side $BF_{10} = 6.37$, $\mu = -16.85$,
  $95\%~CI = [-33.74; -11.10]$.
  
The Intercept coefficient is showing us that the single case is generally
slower than the Control Sample (generally speaking, when you analyse healthy
controls
against a single case with a specific disease, the single case is slower).

All the main effects can be further analysed by simply looking at their
estimates (knowing the contrast matrix and the direction of the estimate
you can understand which level is greater than the other), or by means
of the `pairwise.BMSC` function, if you also want marginal effects
and automatic plots.

The interactions require the use of the `pairwise.BMSC` function.

#### The Body District : Congruency interaction:

```{r}
p4 <- pairwise.BMSC(mdl , contrast = "Body.District2:Congruency2" , who = "delta")

print( p4 , digits = 3 )
```

The `pairwise.BMSC` function shows that in all cases the marginal effects of the
RTs where greater than zero, but the differences where present only in
the comparison between FOOT Congruent and the other cases.

```{r, fig.show="hold"}
plot( p4 , type = "interval")

plot( p4 , type = "area")

plot( p4 , type = "hist")
```

In this case we can observe that the single case was more facilitated
by the FOOT Congruent condition than the Control Group.

If the interpretation of the results is difficult, it can be useful look
what happens in the Single Case marginal effects.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
p5 <- pairwise.BMSC(mdl , contrast = "Body.District2:Congruency2" ,
                    who = "singlecase")

plot( p5 , type = "hist")[[1]]
```

#### The Body District : Congruency interaction:

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
p6 <- pairwise.BMSC(mdl , contrast = "Body.District2:Side2" , who = "delta")

print( p6 , digits = 3 )

plot( p6 , type = "hist")[[1]] +
  theme_bw( base_size = 18)+
  theme( strip.text.y = element_text( angle = 0 ) )
```

In this case, we can see that the left - right difference in the single
case is always present, with faster RTs in the left foot than in the other
cases.

#### The Body District : Congruency : Side interaction:

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
p7 <- pairwise.BMSC(mdl ,
                    contrast = "Body.District2:Congruency2:Side2" ,
                    who = "delta")

print( p7 , digits = 3 )

plot( p7 , type = "hist")[[1]] +
  theme_bw( base_size = 18)+
  theme( strip.text.y = element_text( angle = 0 ) )
```

Here we can see that the effect was pushed by the facilitation
that the single case had in the Left Congruent Foot condition
compared to the Control Group.

## Conclusions

In this vignette we have seen how to use the package **bmscstan**
and its functions to analyse and make sense of Single Case data.

The output of the main functions is rich of information, and the 
Bayesian Inference can be done by taking into account the Savage-Dickey
$BF_{10}$, or the $95\%$ CI [see @Kruschke2014 for further details].

In this vignette there is almost no discussion concerning how to test the
Single Case fixed effects (third part of the main output), but it was used
to better understand what happens in the differences between the 
single case and the control group.

However, if your hypotheses focus on the behaviour of the patient, and not
only on the differences between single case and the control group,
it will be important to analyse in detail also that part.
